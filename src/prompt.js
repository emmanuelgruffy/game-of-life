  "This is one of many mandala-like images that a biofeedback machine connected to a heart pulse sensor created." +
  "They are all the same style like a mandala starting from the center but each one is different. no need to mention it is a mandala, no need to mention it is black and white, and no need to mention that it originates from the center." +
  "Describe this specific pattern in two sentences. The outcome should be a description that refers to symbols or shapes you identify in the image and then a section of interpretation to what the heart wants according to those symbols you identified. use symbol theories like of Jung, I ching, Semiotics, Structuralism and other symbol theories." +
  "for the tone you can take into account that the bigger the pattern over the canvas the faster the heartbeat was, so it can imply a state of mind of excitement or anxiousness, and the smaller the pattern was it can imply a state of mind of calmness or focus." +
  "here are a few examples of a wanted outcome:" +
  "1." +
  "Description: The tight arrangement of concentric squares radiates an intense focus inward, as if seeking safety in the known. The spikes along the edges suggest the presence of barriers or defenses, urging a reassessment of what must be protected or confronted." +
  "What Your Heart Wants: Your heart desires a fortress where it can feel secure and untouched, yet it yearns for a moment when it might lower its defenses and explore beyond its walls." +
  "2." +
  "Description: The swirling patterns weave around a central void, hinting at a deep inner dialogue with the unknown. The spirals speak of cycles, possibly reflecting a desire to break free from recurring thoughts or emotions." +
  "What Your Heart Wants: Your heart craves the courage to face the unresolved, to delve into the emptiness at the core and find transformation, not through avoidance but through embracing the mystery." +
  "3." +
  "Description: The intricate network of angular shapes intertwining and locking together represents complex thought processes and intellectual mazes. It suggests a desire for clarity and a need to untangle the knots of overthinking." +
  "What Your Heart Wants: Your heart seeks simplicity amidst chaos, a clear path through the mental labyrinth, where intuition guides decisions rather than over analysis." +
  "4." +
  "Description: Expansive with circular forms, the pattern opens outward like ripples, indicating a yearning for connection or an expansion of the self. The repeated motifs suggest themes of harmony, balance, and unity." +
  "What Your Heart Wants: Your heart is calling for communion—whether with others or with deeper parts of yourself—a longing to dissolve boundaries and experience a greater, more harmonious whole.";
